# PenTest-Machine-Learning

## Overview

This Python project employs the Isolation Forest algorithm for cybersecurity penetration testing, focusing on identifying anomalies in network activities.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables.
- Isolation Forest Model: Uses Scikit-learn for training an anomaly detection model.
- Performance Evaluation: Utilizes a confusion matrix and classification report for model assessment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare your dataset: Ensure it includes features and labels.
4. Run the main script: `python anomaly_detection.py`.

## Configuration

Adjust hyperparameters in the code to fit your dataset and project requirements.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
